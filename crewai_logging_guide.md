‚úÖ 1. Verbose Mode
Each agent and the crew can be configured with verbose=True, which enables logging of the agent's internal "thoughts" and reasoning steps to the console.

agent = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Analyze financial trends',
  verbose=True,  # Enables internal thought logging
  ...
)
‚úÖ 2. Capturing Output Programmatically
Each Task can log to an output_file:

task = Task(
  description="Analyze Q2 revenue trends",
  expected_output="A markdown report",
  output_file="logs/q2_revenue_analysis.md",  # Logs task output
  ...
)
‚úÖ 3. Agent Thoughts & Reasoning
If you're using verbose=True, thoughts (internal LLM reasoning) are printed to stdout, but you might want to capture them programmatically. For that:

üõ†Ô∏è Solution:
Monkey-patching the logging function or wrapping the crew.kickoff() inside a logging capture context can help. Example:

import sys
import io

# Capture stdout
buffer = io.StringIO()
sys.stdout = buffer

result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'Generative AI'})

# Restore stdout
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

# Save captured logs to a file
with open('logs/crew_thoughts.log', 'w') as f:
    f.write(buffer.getvalue())

‚úÖ 4. Add Custom Logging
If you want more structured logging, you can use Python's logging module or even instrument agents or tools with custom loggers.

Example:

import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='logs/crew_debug.log', level=logging.INFO)

logging.info("Starting crew execution...")
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'LLMs in finance'})
logging.info("Crew finished. Result: %s", result)

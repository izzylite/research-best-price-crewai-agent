# Enhanced Feedback System for Perplexity Retailer Research Tool

## üéØ Overview

The Perplexity Retailer Research Tool has been enhanced to support dynamic, feedback-driven search instructions. This enables the ResearchAgent to provide targeted search guidance based on validation feedback, creating a truly functional feedback loop system.

## üîß Key Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced Tool Input Schema**

The tool now accepts three parameters instead of two:

```python
class RetailerResearchInput(BaseModel):
    product_query: str = Field(..., description="Specific product to search for")
    max_retailers: int = Field(5, description="Maximum number of retailers to find")
    search_instructions: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Optional enhanced search instructions based on feedback")
```

### 2. **System Role Architecture**

**Before:** All instructions were in the user prompt
**After:** Base guidelines moved to system role, dynamic instructions in user prompt

```python
# System Role (Fixed Guidelines)
"You are an expert UK retail researcher specializing in finding legitimate online retailers..."

# User Role (Dynamic Instructions)
"Find UK retailers that sell {product} focusing on major supermarkets, avoiding price comparison sites..."
```

### 3. **Feedback-Driven Prompt Generation**

The ResearchAgent can now pass specific search instructions based on validation feedback:

```python
# Enhanced search instructions example
search_instructions = """Find UK retailers that sell iPhone 15 Pro. 
Focus on major UK electronics retailers. Search for official Apple authorized retailers. 
Prioritize: Currys, John Lewis, Amazon UK, Argos
Search terms: iPhone 15 Pro official UK retailers, iPhone 15 Pro buy online UK authorized
Avoid: Found price comparison sites instead of direct retailers"""
```

## üîÑ Feedback Loop Flow

### Step 1: Initial Research
```python
# ResearchAgent calls tool with basic parameters
tool._run(
    product_query="iPhone 15 Pro",
    max_retailers=5
    # No search_instructions = uses default prompt
)
```

### Step 2: Validation Failure
```python
# ValidationAgent identifies issues and generates targeted feedback
validation_feedback = {
    "research_feedback": {
        "issues": ["Found price comparison sites instead of direct retailers"],
        "retry_recommendations": ["Focus on major UK electronics retailers"],
        "alternative_retailers": ["Currys", "John Lewis", "Amazon UK"],
        "search_refinements": ["iPhone 15 Pro official UK retailers"]
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Enhanced Retry
```python
# ResearchAgent builds enhanced instructions from feedback
enhanced_instructions = build_enhanced_instructions(validation_feedback)

# Tool called with enhanced search guidance
tool._run(
    product_query="iPhone 15 Pro",
    max_retailers=5,
    search_instructions=enhanced_instructions  # Feedback-driven instructions
)
```

## üìã Implementation Details

### Tool Enhancement (`perplexity_retailer_research_tool.py`)

1. **Updated Input Schema**: Added `search_instructions` parameter
2. **Enhanced `_run` method**: Accepts and processes search instructions
3. **Modified `_build_retailer_research_prompt`**: Uses dynamic instructions when provided
4. **System Role Guidelines**: Moved base research guidelines to system message
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Default prompt used when no instructions provided

### ResearchAgent Enhancement (`research_agent.py`)

1. **Feedback-Enhanced Task**: `create_feedback_enhanced_research_task()` method
2. **Dynamic Instruction Building**: Constructs search instructions from validation feedback
3. **Tool Parameter Mapping**: Passes feedback components to tool's search_instructions
4. **Improved Task Description**: Guides agent to use enhanced search capabilities

## üéØ Benefits of Enhanced System

### 1. **Targeted Retries**
- Addresses specific validation failures
- Avoids repeating the same research mistakes
- Focuses on recommended retailers and search terms

### 2. **Improved Success Rates**
- Uses validation feedback to refine search strategy
- Prioritizes legitimate retailers over comparison sites
- Applies learned knowledge from previous attempts

### 3. **Dynamic Adaptability**
- Each retry is more informed than the previous attempt
- Adapts search strategy based on specific failure patterns
- Continuously improves research quality

### 4. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing code continues to work without changes
- Default behavior preserved when no feedback provided
- Gradual adoption of enhanced features possible

## üîç Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Price Comparison Site Issue
```python
# Feedback: "Found price comparison sites instead of direct retailers"
# Enhanced Instructions: "Focus on direct UK retailers like ASDA, Tesco, Amazon UK. Avoid price comparison sites."
```

### Scenario 2: Invalid Product URLs
```python
# Feedback: "URLs led to search pages rather than product pages"
# Enhanced Instructions: "Find direct product page URLs, not search results or category pages."
```

### Scenario 3: Wrong Retailer Types
```python
# Feedback: "Found international retailers instead of UK-based stores"
# Enhanced Instructions: "Focus specifically on UK-based retailers that ship within the UK."
```

## üöÄ Testing the Enhanced System

Run the test script to see the enhanced feedback system in action:

```bash
python test_enhanced_feedback_system.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Basic research (backward compatibility)
- Feedback-enhanced research (new functionality)
- Full validation feedback simulation (complete loop)

## üìà Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- **Higher Success Rates**: Targeted retries address specific issues
- **Better Data Quality**: Focus on legitimate retailers
- **Reduced Wasted Attempts**: Avoid repeating failed strategies

### Considerations:
- **Slightly Longer Prompts**: Enhanced instructions add context
- **API Call Efficiency**: Better targeting reduces need for multiple retries
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal impact from additional parameter

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Learning Memory**: Store successful search patterns for future use
2. **Retailer Scoring**: Rank retailers based on success history
3. **Category-Specific Instructions**: Tailor search strategies by product category
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Extend to other markets beyond UK

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The enhanced feedback system transforms the Perplexity Retailer Research Tool from a static search tool into a dynamic, learning system that improves with each validation cycle. This creates a truly functional feedback loop that drives continuous improvement in retailer discovery quality.

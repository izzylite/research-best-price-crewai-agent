# SimplifiedStagehandTool Error Fixes

## Summary
Fixed critical errors in the SimplifiedStagehandTool that were causing crashes and preventing proper operation. The main issues were related to logger errors, session management, and connection handling.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AttributeError: '_Null' object has no attribute 'error'
**Problem**: The `_Null` logger class was missing the `error` method, causing crashes when error logging was attempted.

**Solution**: 
- Added `error` method to the `_NullLogger` class
- Made the logger delegate error calls to the actual error logger (`_error_logger`)
- Provided fallback to print if no error logger is available

**Files Changed**: `ecommerce_scraper/tools/simplified_stagehand_tool.py`

### 2. Session Connection Issues
**Problem**: Network connection errors like `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'stream'` and `httpx.ReadError` were not properly handled.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error detection patterns in `_is_session_closed_error()` method
- Added more connection error patterns: ReadTimeout, ConnectError, NetworkError
- Fixed typo in error pattern (`noneype` â†’ `nonetype`)
- Added connection validation method `_validate_session()`
- Improved session initialization with retry logic

### 3. Session Management Improvements
**Problem**: Sessions could become stale or disconnected without proper detection.

**Solution**:
- Added `_validate_session()` method to check session health
- Enhanced `_get_stagehand()` to validate existing sessions before reuse
- Added retry logic in session initialization (up to 3 attempts)
- Improved session recovery mechanisms

### 4. Error Handling Enhancements
**Problem**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult.

**Solution**:
- Added specific error message handling for common issues
- Improved error messages for missing credentials
- Better handling of network connection errors
- More informative error reporting

### 5. Pydantic Schema Warning Fix
**Problem**: Pydantic warning about field name "schema" shadowing parent attribute.

**Solution**:
- Renamed `schema` field to `extraction_schema` in `SimplifiedStagehandInput`
- Maintained backward compatibility by supporting both field names
- Updated documentation examples

## Error Patterns Now Handled

The tool now properly detects and handles these error patterns:
- `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'stream'`
- `httpx.ReadError`
- `httpx.ReadTimeout`
- `httpx.ConnectError`
- `httpx.NetworkError`
- `connection broken`
- `connection reset`
- `connection aborted`
- `session is closed`
- `session closed`
- `browser has been closed`
- `target page, context or browser has been closed`
- `execution context was destroyed`

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_simplified_stagehand_fixes.py`) that verifies:
- Logger error method functionality
- Error detection patterns
- Tool initialization
- Operation error handling

All tests pass successfully.

## Impact
These fixes resolve the critical crashes that were preventing the ecommerce scraper from functioning properly. The tool now has:
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Better session management
- Improved connection stability
- More informative error messages
- Comprehensive logging without crashes

## Files Modified
1. `ecommerce_scraper/tools/simplified_stagehand_tool.py` - Main fixes
2. `test_simplified_stagehand_fixes.py` - Test suite (new)
3. `SIMPLIFIED_STAGEHAND_TOOL_FIXES.md` - This documentation (new)

## Next Steps
The SimplifiedStagehandTool should now work reliably without the AttributeError crashes. The enhanced session management and error handling should provide better stability for the ecommerce scraping operations.
